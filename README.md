Project: Simple Bank System

Objective:

Develop a console-based bank management system using fundamental OOP principles in C++ to simulate basic banking operations.

Requirements:

  1. Classes:
     - Account: A class with attributes such as account number, account holder's name, and balance. Methods include deposit and withdraw, which demonstrate the use of encapsulation by controlling access to the balance.

     - Bank: A class to manage multiple accounts. It includes methods to create new accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and display account details.
  2. Features:
     - Create new accounts.
     
     - Deposit money into an account.
    
     - Withdraw money from an account (ensure no overdrafts occur).

     - Display account details.

     - Use encapsulation to protect the integrity of account data.

  3. Interface:
     - Use a simple text-based menu for interaction.
       
     - Options should include creating accounts, making deposits/withdrawals, and displaying account details.

Guidelines:

  - Emphasize encapsulation by using private data members and public methods to safely manipulate the data.
  - Demonstrate abstraction by simplifying complex operations behind intuitive interfaces.
  - Use appropriate constructors for initial setup and destructors for cleanup, if needed.
  - Error handling should be implemented to manage user input errors and enforce account rules like preventing overdrafts.

Submission:
  - Source code files and any additional documentation.  
  - A brief report describing their design decisions, the OOP principles implemented, and specifically how encapsulation and abstraction are used.
